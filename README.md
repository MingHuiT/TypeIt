# TypeIt

Welcome to my latest project, a web application crafted using the dynamic trio of **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. This creation was inspired by a fantastic tutorial by CodingWithDawid, which guided me through the process of turning my vision into a reality. 

With every line of code, I've poured my creativity and passion into this project. Join me on this journey as I unveil the magic that HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can create when combined in the right way.
